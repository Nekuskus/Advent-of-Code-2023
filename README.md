# Kuskus's Advent of Code 2023
This repository is my journey through 2023's AoC challenge, learning how to code in Rust as I go. 
(As a result, the code quality and use of Rust-specific patterns raises slightly with each file. It will stay that way until I go back to do revisions later in December.)
